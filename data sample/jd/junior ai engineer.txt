Position Responsibilities

As a Junior AI Engineer (1–2 years experience), you will contribute to designing, developing, and deploying AI-driven solutions. Your day-to-day work may include:

 Building AI-powered applications using LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP)
 Implementing capabilities such as function calling, agent orchestration, and tool integration
 Benchmarking AI models using LLM-as-a-Judge, few-shot evaluation methods, and automated testing pipelines
 Applying and experimenting with model optimization and quantization techniques
 Containerizing and deploying applications using Docker and Docker Compose
 Using Hugging Face Transformers for embeddings, tokenization, and text classification
 Working with vector databases for semantic search and retrieval
 Applying image processing and computer-vision techniques using OpenCV (segmentation, feature extraction, object detection)
 Fine-tuning deep learning and machine learning models
 Integrating applications with relational and non-relational databases (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
 Working with queuing and task orchestration frameworks for background processing

Required Competencies

Candidates with 1 to 2 years of hands-on experience in AI/ML engineering are preferred, with:

 Strong proficiency in Python
 Familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow
 Good understanding of core ML/NLP concepts, including LLMs and RAG workflows
 Experience working in Unix/Linux environments
 Exposure to asynchronous frameworks (FastAPI, asyncio, etc.)
 Comfort working with Docker and containerized environments
 Practical experience with Git and version control

Preferred Skills (Nice-to-Haves)

These are not mandatory but will strengthen your application:

 Understanding of quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, etc.)
 Experience using Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks
 Familiarity with vector databases like Qdrant or ChromaDB
 Experience with computer vision and OpenCV
 Exposure to databases (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
 Familiarity with queuing systems (RabbitMQ, Redis Queue, etc.)
 Understanding of MCP and agent orchestration tools (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, etc.)

What Matters Most

You don’t need to have mastered everything. We value curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion for building real AI products. If you are motivated, eager to experiment, and ready to grow in a hands-on environment, we encourage you to apply.
